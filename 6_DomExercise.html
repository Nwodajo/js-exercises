<html>
  <body>
    Animals:
    <ol id="ol1">
      <li>Frog</li>
      <li>Dog</li>
      <li>Bunny</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="id1">
      <p>This is the text in div id1</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
    </div>

    <p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

    <div class="myClass">I love learning about HTML and JavaScript</div>

    <p class="myClass">Coding is fun</p>

    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <br /><br />
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
  </body>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"
const id2 = document.getElementById("id2");
id2.textContent = "Here's some new text";
    // Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
const id1 = document.getElementById("id1");
id1.style.color = "green";
    // Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
const myClassEls = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
console.log("myClass elements:", myClassEls);
    // Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
console.log("Children of #id1:", id1.children);
    // Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
const allLis = document.querySelectorAll("li");
console.log("All <li>:", allLis);
    // Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
console.log("Number of <li> items:", allLis.length);
    // Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
const ol = document.getElementById("ol1");
const newLi = document.createElement("li");
newLi.textContent = "Koala";
ol.appendChild(newLi);
    // Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
    // an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".
const btn1 = document.getElementById("button1");
btn1.addEventListener("click", () => {
alert("Hi from Techtonica");
});

    // Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
    /// The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

// The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree representation of the HTML page.
// JavaScript can read and change this tree to update what you see in the browser
// (text, styles, attributes, and even add/remove elements).

    // Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
    // Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.
for (let i = 0; i < myClassEls.length; i++) {
if (!myClassEls[i].textContent.endsWith("!")) {
myClassEls[i].textContent = myClassEls[i].textContent + "!";
}
}

    // Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
    // the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100

    // How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
    // What references did you use to help?
    // Please put your answers in a comment below:
    //
    const btn2 = document.getElementById("button2");
btn2.addEventListener("click", () => {
for (let i = 0; i < id1.children.length; i++) {
const rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
id1.children[i].textContent = rand;
}
});
